// why we go for stateless when we have stateful APIs

Stateless API
Definition:
A stateless API does not store any information about the client or session between requests.

Characteristics:
Every request is independent.

The server does not remember anything about previous requests.

The client must send all necessary data with each request (like authentication tokens, etc.).

Common in REST APIs.

Example:
http
Copy
Edit
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Even if the user just logged in, the server won’t remember it. The client must send the token every time.

Pros:
Scalable

Simple to cache

Easier to maintain

Cons:
More overhead on each request

Less flexible for complex interactions

Stateful API
Definition:
A stateful API retains information about the client between requests. It maintains state (like user sessions).

Characteristics:
Requests are dependent on previous ones.

Server maintains session info (e.g., using session ID).

Often seen in SOAP APIs, older systems, or specific use cases (like online games, banking sessions).

Example:
User logs in.

Server stores session and returns session ID.

Next requests rely on that session being active.

Pros:
Reduces repeated data transmission

Useful for long-lived sessions or transactions

Cons:
Less scalable (server must track sessions)

More complex to manage (session timeout, memory usage, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We often prefer stateless APIs over stateful ones—especially in modern web development—for performance, scalability, and simplicity.


1. Scalability
Stateless APIs don’t store session info on the server, so any server can handle any request.

This makes it easy to add more servers (horizontal scaling) and balance load.

Example: If a website gets heavy traffic, more stateless servers can be spun up without worrying about shared session memory.


2. Simplicity & Reliability
No need to manage session storage, session timeouts, or cleanup.

Less chance of bugs from outdated or corrupted session data.

Each request is independent and self-contained—easy to debug and understand.


3. Caching Benefits
Since each request is complete and independent, responses can be easily cached by browsers or CDN servers.

Cached GET requests mean faster load times and reduced server load.


4. Better for Microservices & Cloud Architectures
In cloud-native apps (like those using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.), services may move or restart.

Stateless design ensures no problem if a server restarts or crashes—no session data is lost.


5. Security
Stateless APIs often use token-based authentication (like JWT), which is safer and more scalable than session IDs.

No need to store session info means less chance of session hijacking.



When to Use Stateful APIs
We still use stateful APIs when:

Session continuity is critical (like online banking or gaming).

Real-time interaction is needed (like with WebSockets).

We need transaction tracking or multi-step workflows.

We go for stateless APIs in most modern systems because they’re scalable, efficient, and easier to manage—perfect for distributed environments and cloud-native apps.
